In this repository, you will find  3 codes linked to the replication work of  *Korpela et al. Proceedings B 2014* . We modify the models used by the authors in order to try new hypotheses and draw new conclusions. We made this modifications steps by steps, each code matches with one step. 

*Step 1*:  we consider $ARX(1)$ models for vole, so that predators (whose dynamics also respond to vole) can make cyclicity emerge through the predator-prey interactions. 

Step 2:  we consider that predator's density growth rate between the years $t-1$ and $t$ is depending upon the current/immediately preceding predator density (at $t-1$), so we add a new coefficient $\alpha$ in the 3 predators models.

Step 3:  we  add interactions between predators so we add 2 coeffcients in each predators models (for the 2 other predators categories.)
